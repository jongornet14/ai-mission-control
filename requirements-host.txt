# AI Mission Control - Host System Requirements
# These are the minimal requirements for the host system to run the Docker container

# System Requirements:
# - Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (recommended) or compatible Linux distribution
# - Docker Engine 20.10.0 or later
# - Docker Compose 1.29.0 or later (optional)
# - NVIDIA GPU drivers 470.57.02 or later (for GPU support)
# - nvidia-docker2 (for GPU support)

# Minimum Hardware:
# - CPU: 4+ cores (8+ recommended)
# - RAM: 8GB (16GB+ recommended for large experiments)
# - Storage: 50GB free space (100GB+ recommended)
# - GPU: NVIDIA GPU with 6GB+ VRAM (optional but recommended)

# Python packages needed on host (only for setup script):
# No additional Python packages required on host system
# All ML/RL dependencies are contained within the Docker image

# Installation verification:
# Run: python3 setup.py install ./my_project
# Or: ./build.sh

# Quick verification commands:
# docker --version          # Should be 20.10.0+
# docker-compose --version  # Should be 1.29.0+
# nvidia-smi                # Should show GPU info (if using GPU)
# docker info | grep nvidia # Should show nvidia runtime (if using GPU)
